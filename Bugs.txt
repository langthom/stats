1) Infinity:
------------
If you run the program with the testing file Test.csv, the 
geometric mean will return "Infinity".
This may be caused by the file size, as the geometric
mean is defined as  n-th root of the product of all
values, where n is the length of the data list.

For smaller files like  Test2.csv  this works perfectly.
