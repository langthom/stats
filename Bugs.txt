                -------------

1) Infinity:
------------
If you run the program with the testing file Test.csv, the 
geometric mean will return "Infinity".
This may be caused by the file size, as the geometric
mean is defined as  n-th root of the product of all
values, where n is the length of the data list.

For smaller files like  Test2.csv  this works perfectly.



2) Dimension too large:
-----------------------
If the numbers in the file get too high, LaTex (Tikz)
cannot handle this. E.g. if you use the "--plot" argument
on stats with the file "Test.csv", the output will be
written correctly, but LaTex will not properly compile it.
